### Goal
* Learn concepts on Histogram Equalization
* Apply Histogram Equalization to improve the contrast of images
* Apply Histogram Equalization to improve the contrast of color images
    - Hint: OpenCV has a function to do this, `cv2.equalizeHist()`
    
1. Histogram Equalization to improve the contrast of a dark image
2. Histogram Equalization to improve the contrast of a bright image
3. Histogram Equalization to improve the contrast of a dark and bright image
4. Color Histogram Equalization to improve the contrast of color image
